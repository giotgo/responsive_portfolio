Sorry, guys, this a a WIP, so at the moment the website is working only in its mobile version.

Please try to access it on your smartphone using the following URL: https://giotgo.github.io/responsive_portfolio/

Alternatively, you can right-click the browser viewport and click "Inspect" (or hit "Ctrl + Shift + I" on your keyboard),
then hit "Ctrl + Shift + M" to enable the device toolbar and select one of the smartphone options in the list.

Thanks!
